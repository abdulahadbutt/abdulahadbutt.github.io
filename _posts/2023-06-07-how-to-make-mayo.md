# Why make your own Mayo?
This may seem like a weird post about in my blog which is primarily about which technology I come across, but I've decided to expand my blog's domain to anything that I find interesting. 

Now why should anyone make their own mayo? First off, it's the ease. Making your own mayonnaise is suprisingly easy, and requires minimal effort. Secondly, you can customize your own mayo with different sauces to suite it to your taste. But finally, it's fun.

Now without further ado, here's the recipe for mayonnaise that I got from a dear friend of mine. 

# Ingredients
Here's what you need to make mayo for one egg

- 1 egg
- 1 tbsp red chilli
- 1 tbsp mustard
- 1/4th cup soy sauce
- 1/4th cup vinegar
- 2 tsp suqar
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 3 cloves of garlic or 1tsp garlic powder
- Regular cooking oil

You'll also need a way to blend these


# Instructions
Add all the ingredients into a blender and blend till fine. Then while the blender is running, keep adding vegetable oil or regular cooking oil into the mix. When you start to get the consistency of regular mayonnaise, you may stop adding the oil. 


And that's it! Pretty easy if you ask me.
