## Welcome to My First Post
I'll mostly just use this post to see what kind of stuff I can add in this site.


You can use backticks to emphasize words, like `this` 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets, some of which I will show off here:
{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd 
# Pandas is a module

df = pd.read_csv('path/to/csv/file')
print(df.head())
{% endhighlight %}


If you're an employer, please take a look at my **[resume](/resume/)**
