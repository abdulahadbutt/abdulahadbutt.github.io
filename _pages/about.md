Hi, I'm **Abdul Ahad Butt**, a Master's student in **Computer Vision** at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Ivan Laptev](https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/). I hold a BEng in **Electrical Engineering** from [SEECS, NUST](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/), where I conducted my undergraduate research under the guidance of [Dr. Wajahat Hussain](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=W1p1zl4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Human-Object Interaction Synthesis**, **Human Motion Generation**, and **human-scene interaction**. Recently, Iâ€™ve broadened my focus to explore state-of-the-art approaches including **diffusion models** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly for enhancing object interaction and scene understanding in intelligent systems.
